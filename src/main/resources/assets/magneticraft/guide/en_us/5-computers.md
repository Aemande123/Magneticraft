# Computers

there are computers and mining robots (more types are planned)
The computer is an emulator of a MIPS R3000 processor.

The specs of the computer are:
- CPU clock speed is 1MHz
- RAM is 64KB
- Floppy disks have 128 blocks of 1024 bytes

To run the computer there are 3 buttons on the bottom left part of the GUI, 
the first button starts the CPU clock, 
the second stops the CPU clock, 
and the third loads the bios into the RAM, so basically resets the computer.
In order to start the computer you need a floppy disk with an operative system or a program, 
the bios will load the data from the floppy and start the program/OS.
The current available OS are FORTH, Lisp, and small Assembler of MIPS (WIP)
