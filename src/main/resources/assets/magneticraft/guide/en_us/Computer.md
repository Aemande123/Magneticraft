### Computers

Right now there is only one type of computer implemented. 
The computer is an emulator of a MIPS R3000 processor.

The specs of the computer are:
- The processor clock speed is 1MHz
- RAM has 64K
- Floppy disks have 128 blocks of 1024 bytes

To run the computer there are 3 buttons on the bottom left part of the GUI, the first button starts the CPU clock, the second stops the CPU clock, and the third loads the bios into the RAM, so basically resets the computer
